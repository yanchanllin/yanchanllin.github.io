I was building a CLI Tic Tac Toe game at object orientation Tic Tac Toe earlier and learned something new, I learned initialize method can be used after Class;        
   We know that any Ruby class can produce new instances of itself, via the <Class Name>.new method, whether or not that class has an #initialize method. However, if we want each instance of our class to be created with certain attributes, we must define an #initialize method. An #initialize method is a method that is called automatically whenever #new is used.
   When #new is called with an argument, it will pass that argument (or arguments) to the #initialize method and invoke that method. The code in #initialize will then run, using any arguments from #new.
     In this lab initialize method should set a @board variable equal to a new, empty array that represents the game board.
		 
         `class TicTacToe
				 
             def initialize (board= [" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "])  
              @board = board
             end
					
            def board=(board)
               @board = board
            end
						
           def board
             @board
           end
				 end`
					 
Since we have initialize the board at the beginning, now we can use  @board in later helper methods. We donâ€™t need to put an additional argument of board.
