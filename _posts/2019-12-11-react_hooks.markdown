  I wanted to learn Hooks a long time ago, when I first learn react. Today I'm going to write some notes here for what I have learned so far for hooks. Hooks are added to React 16.8 in late 2018, it's fairly new to the technology world but some companies out there are using it already for like a year now. Hooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.  

 When should we want to use hooks? while we want to break complex stateful components down because the logic is stateful and can’t be extracted to a function or another component. Therefore they invented hooks to useState it's using the state hook; to organize the state inside a component then we can use it again in a stateful component that are isolated units. 
	 
 Hooks will minimize the codes and concepts in the React because using Hooks tends to minify better than equivalent code using classes. React will be simpler when there was just one common way to code again, also React hooks are JavaScript functions thus you can add used hooks to build your own hooks.

 A custom Hook is a JavaScript function where starts with ”use” and that may call other Hooks to use later, to pass information between hooks.
