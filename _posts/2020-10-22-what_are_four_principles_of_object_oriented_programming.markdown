Four principles of OOP are encapsulation, abstract, inheritances, and polymorphism:

Encapsulation is hiding private data for the public to see it for safety, and accessor methods are made public.

Abstract means a class should not know the inner details of another in order to use it. For example you do not need to know the inner detail of a coffee machine, you can still use it.

Inheritances means a relationship between two objects by using “is-a” or “has-a”. 

Polymorphism is a greek word meaning one name in many forms. It is related to inheritance, superclass code will work with subclass type too.


For example newsletter to explain get, post, and put:

GET is to show all newsletters

POST is create a new newsletter

PUT is used to send data to a server to update a resource.

Arrays are ordered, collections of any object. 

A Hash is a group of key value pairs. It is similar to an Array, the corresponding keys were inserted.
