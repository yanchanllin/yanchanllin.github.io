It's been a long way since the beginning of this code learning to now, what a great adventure so far from basic ruby to publish my first gem in my CLI project. It is my first project and final project for ruby, more than 250 lessons learned and the labs I did are mostly preparing for this project. 

Sometime I feel stress out, but after I pass labs one by one; I feel good about myself and so excite to learn more and more. All the late night studies for tic tac toe labs and early coding are worth it, I can't wait what is next. 

This CLI project got me nervous at the beginning, but I started to read some examples from instructors and using my google skills to search around. Step by step slowly I started coding my own gem when I didn't realize it, first I created a note.md to write down all my ideas; which I want to locate all the libraries at Queens,NY. http://www.queenslibrary.org/ql_findabranch

Then I started creating my gem by using bundle gem, and I want to get data like location name, address and phone number from Queens library website. I can program scraper first to get information from there, which I can require nokogiri to find the name and grab whatever I want from the page. So I can use it later for cli, before I create cli I need have a location.rb to initialize, def all and def doc etc. finally for cli.rb I started calling the scraper and welcoming the user to start. In def start to begin user needed information; starting to ask them questions and get input from user. I will print locations by number or index offer user to choose from, therefore the input will be integer here. Then ask question again and get input and have the option to get last input to end or continue or greet user goodbye. Cleaned up my code follow the instruction on learn to write README.md and spec.md etc.

Just like that I finished coding my first project, it is super magical for a new programmer. I enjoy problem solving at the end, just remember current obstacle will only help my learning and be better in the future.
