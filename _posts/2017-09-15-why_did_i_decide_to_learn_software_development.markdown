There are many reasons why I decide to learn software development, first I start to learn coding when I was in high
school, I was curious about how web works. Then I taught myself using HTML and played on Myspace. I really like how it turn out and which was very interesting. Later in college, for club projects I was taught by my friends to make a website, web development has always been very exciting to learn, I like to check what's new on the web every day and what I can make. 
After learning about tech products from my previous company, I understand how fast it can help people and provides value so quickly. I want to be that helper and this is what I want to do as my full-time career; tech skills are in demand and there are many other opportunities in the field, so I start searching for schools and found flatiron online program. Since I have a family now online classes are more convenient for me, plus many of the companies do pay good salary. so here i go, wish me good luck!
