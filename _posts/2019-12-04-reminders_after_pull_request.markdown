When you click on `new pull request` to merge in with master, be careful here do not merge in with other branch; master branch is where final changes are. Therefore the new pull request will have to wait to be review for potential changes by the other collaborator, the collaborator can either accept to approve merge or deny it request to make change and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch. 

After that collaborator approved for this new pull request, click on `confirm merge` to merge into master. On group github will show the new changes of codes in the file, do not forget the last step on the terminal `git pull upstream master` to update your master branch with all the new changes. Thus the updated changes that show in your VScode will also show on your github master branch. Next time, when you want to make any changes to your github repository all the files will be up to date to edit. 

Pull requests are important because they help make sure all the code that merged are good codes into GitHub repositories, messy and confusing code can easily run into errors in the base branch. Pull requests allow for programmers to efficiently review and quickly merge code into master, letting other collabrators know what had changed since the last update. Therefore it will not cause confusion and two people will not working on the same mission.
