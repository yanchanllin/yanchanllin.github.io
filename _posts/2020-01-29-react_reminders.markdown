npm is a package manager for JavaScript. This means that npm works with your JavaScript project directories via the command line, allowing you to install packages of preexisting code.

The package.json file is a key part of sharing JS code repositories on sites like GitHub. Instead of having to include all the dependencies' code with every project, we just include a small file, listing out what npm needs to get for the project.

This works because the command npm test is saying: "Hey npm, look in package.json and find the script with the name of 'test', then execute its value in the terminal."
