 My sinatra project is to build a music band application,something fun about  instruments  of users who use them at the band, users should be able to take actions sign up and login in; then create their own band add their own instruments. 

* Users
* Music bands
* instruments

Also users can edit and delete their own band information and view all the band later, if they want to which I instore it in views folder it edit the page, create, and show the page. A user can only modify their own page. models folder using multiple objects that interact, including separate classes use ActiveRecord to help build method to model out the relation between. most importantly application controller help to control the system to get, to post, to patch using sinatra; it take actions that map to the correct routes. db folder migrate tables for music bands, instruments, and users.  

The app is extremely simple in design but I do think that it is a good CRUD program, which users can create, read, update, and delete their band. Most importanly I learned alot from sinatra MVC,forms,session,activerecord, and ERB from all the labs,readings I did.
