After you went to that new branch click on “new pull request” to merge in with master, be careful here do not merge in with other branch; master branch is where final changes are. Therefore the new pull request will have to wait to be review for potential changes by the other collaborator, the collaborator can either accept to approve merge or deny it request to make change and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch. 

After that collaborator approved for this new pull request, click on "confirm merge" to merge into master. On group github will show the new changes of codes in the file, the last step on the terminal "git pull upstream master" to update your master branch with all the new changes. Thus the updated changes that show in your VScode will also show on your github master branch. Next time, when you want to make any changes to your github repository
