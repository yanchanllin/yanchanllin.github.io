First of all what is github? I like this description that it is the google drive of code, you push your work to github. Telling your computer to connect with github is through by series of git commands, git is the version control tool that is used to save different versions of your file in a project. 

Commits is everytime you push code to GitHub when you work on your computer locally, then store it in my GitHub repository you have to attach a commit message; but not random messages. Take an extra 15 second to write commit message specific and clear so that when you go back, plus others can look through those commit will know how the project is going. Furthermore alot times stuff breaks again and again, and it's ok github send different versions of your code it helps you revert to an earlier commit. Also GitHub let you try different things, trying things that might not work using; different strategies you can test out. It lets you do that safely and efficiently. Second github can show all the progress you have done even from late last night, and see how far you have done. Another great feature is collaboration, GitHub and git allow us to collaborate with other people easily synchronizes code between different people.
 
Github explore page is where people have their projects and repositories made public, for a long time I mainly have stay on my own personal github page where my projects show up on my profile. Github explore page is very interesting you can read other people's projects, read tools you are using how they fit together. You can collaborate with pull request which someone have a project and you have some ideas to improve this better or fix a bug. First clone the project make that change then create a pull request telling the owner of the repository to accept this proposal or not. If yes for accepting; changes will merge to make the changes in repository. Sometimes it can be no, it's not a good solution or change. But many times if you help people will form a connection even from far away in a different country or so. Github explore is a great place to learn about what other people are doing and may be collaborate on when you are able to improve something.
 
 Static websites through github pages can minimal the steps to create a website, it create static websites that are hosted from your GitHub repository. It start coding on your computer first then push changes to GitHub to update on your repository, github pages documentation will walk you step by step easily, it's a great place to start create web at the beginning. 
 
In conclusion, it's not all of the tools GitHub provide I mentioned only a few of the helpful ways to explore. Commit messages matter it's a great way to reflect on growing as a programmer and problem solving process. Exploring awesome projects and applications pull request give you the chance to connect with an organization, a project. Last start simple web development with github pages can be a great way to begin.
